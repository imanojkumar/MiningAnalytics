### Ask a question

Using MiningAnalytics and got stuck? Browse the [documentation](https://imanojkumar.github.io/MiningAnalytics) to see if you can find a solution. Still stuck? Post your question as an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/imanojkumar/MiningAnalytics/issues/new). While we cannot offer user support, we'll try to do our best to address it, as questions often lead to better documentation or the discovery of bugs.

### Propose an idea

Have an idea for a new MiningAnalytics feature? Take a look at the [documentation](https://imanojkumar.github.io/MiningAnalytics) and [issue list](https://github.com/imanojkumar/MiningAnalytics/issues) to see if it isn't included or suggested yet. If not, suggest your idea as an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/imanojkumar/MiningAnalytics/issues/new). While we can't promise to implement your idea, it helps to:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible.

See below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well.

### Report a bug

Using MiningAnalytics and discovered a bug? That's annoying! Don't let others have the same experience and report it as an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/imanojkumar/MiningAnalytics/issues/new) so we can fix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please include:

- Your operating system name and version (e.g. Windows 11, macOS 14, Ubuntu 22.04).
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Improve the documentation

Noticed a typo on the website? Think a function could use a better example? Good documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very welcome!

#### The website

[This website](https://imanojkumar.github.io/MiningAnalytics) is generated with [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). That means we don't have to write any html: content is pulled together from documentation in the code, vignettes, Markdown files, the package `DESCRIPTION` and `_pkgdown.yml` settings. If you know your way around `pkgdown`, you can [propose a file change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-users-repository/) to improve documentation. If not, [report an issue](https://github.com/imanojkumar/MiningAnalytics/issues/new) and we can point you in the right direction.

#### Function documentation

Functions are described as comments near their code and translated to documentation using [roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/). If you want to improve a function description:

1. Go to the `R/` directory in the [code repository](https://github.com/imanojkumar/MiningAnalytics).
2. Look for the file with the name of the function.
3. [Propose a file change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-users-repository/) to update the function documentation in the roxygen comments (starting with `#'`).
